# GraphQL.js Tutorial

* Starts with <https://graphql.org/graphql-js/>
* Replaces the deprecated `express-graphql` with `graphql-http`
* Adds back GraphiQL (included with `express-graphql` but not `graphql-http`)

## Installation

```sh
make
```

## Usage

First start the server:

```sh
node src/server/main.js
```

Send queries with the CLI with:

```sh
node src/cli/main.js
```

Or, use the GraphiQL Web UI: <http://localhost:4000/graphiql>
